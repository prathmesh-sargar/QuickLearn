# QuickLearn  :

 QuickLearn is a solution designed to simplify studying for DYPCET college students who find themselves in a time crunch. As an Engineering student myself, I understand the struggles of studying at the last minute. QuickLearn provides a platform where students can access subject notes in PDF format, download previous year question papers, and even interact with a bot to get instant answers to their queries. Our goal is to make studying efficient and effective for students who need to maximize their learning in a short span of time.
